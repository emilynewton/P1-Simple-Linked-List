## Experience

This project was such a doozy for me. I was struggling to understand what the instructions wanted. I couldn't understand how to split the list, and if that was even the right thing to do. The second task said that there was only supposed to be one list the threads were fired on, but then the merge function took in two list pointers as the parameters. I just decided to make a split function in my lab.c and split after generating a random list. The threading made sense to me though. Luckily, I have worked with threads before. I chose to do an insertion sort without any rhyme or reason, but it worked out well. I also added a function to generate a random string for data in the randomized linked list and then a function to generate a linked list with random data whether it be integers or strings. This made it really easy to work with in regards to the command arguments and cleaned up my main.c. My favorite part was learning about function pointers. I didn't know that it was possible to pass in one function but have it mean two different things depending on the context. I had the compare_int and compare_str under my Compare function pointer and it was cool that I could just use that function pointer without having to switch between the two functions.
