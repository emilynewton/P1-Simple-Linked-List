## Experience

TODO: I feel like I was able to get a better understanding of the code coverage. In P0, it was like 
okay great it just sees how many lines execute but with this project I was able to understand which ones 
are infeasible in the sense that they are much harder to test. At first, I wanted to put a skip in every instance 
of returning null when really I could make tests and just assert them to null. The only places that did matter to skip were 
places where I attempt to allocate memory to a place that's null. The hardest part about this project was just getting 
back into understanding C. I haven't coded in C really since CS 253 which was a couple years ago so this was a good wake up 
call. I'm glad it was linked lists though because I do feel somewhat comfortable with that concept and the setinel node made 
some sense to me. I had trouble with segmentation faults just because I was forgetting null checks or not using the free function 
properly which is something I'll need more practice with. Honestly though, it was nice to have null checks actually matter 
because I get a little lazy in Java and I feel like the stakes are higher with that kind of stuff in C.
